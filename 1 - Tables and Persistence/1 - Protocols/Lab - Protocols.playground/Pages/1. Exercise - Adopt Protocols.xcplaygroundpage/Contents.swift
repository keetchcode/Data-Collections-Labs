## Exercise - Adopt Protocols: CustomStringConvertible, Equatable, and Comparable
 
 Create a `Human` class with two properties: `name` of type `String`, and `age` of type `Int`. You'll need to create a memberwise initializer for the class. Initialize two `Human` instances.
 */
class Human: CustomStringConvertible, Equatable {
  var description: String {
    return "name: \(name), age: \(age)"
  }

  var name: String = ""
  var age: Int = 0

  static func ==(lhs: Human, rhs: Human) -> Bool {
    return lhs.name == rhs.name && lhs.name == rhs.name
  }

  init(name: String, age: Int) {
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  }
}

let human1 = Human(name: "Wesley", age: 25)
let human2 = Human(name: "Caitlin", age: 24)
//:  Make the `Human` class adopt the `CustomStringConvertible` protocol. Print both of your previously initialized `Human` objects.
print(human1)
print(human2)
//:  Make the `Human` class adopt the `Equatable` protocol. Two instances of `Human` should be considered equal if their names and ages are identical to one another. Print the result of a boolean expression evaluating whether or not your two previously initialized `Human` objects are equal to eachother (using `==`). Then print the result of a boolean expression evaluating whether or not your two previously initialized `Human` objects are not equal to eachother (using `!=`).


//:  Make the `Human` class adopt the `Comparable` protocol. Sorting should be based on age. Create another three instances of a `Human`, then create an array called `people` of type `[Human]` with all of the `Human` objects that you have initialized. Create a new array called `sortedPeople` of type `[Human]` that is the `people` array sorted by age.


//:  Make the `Human` class adopt the `Codable` protocol. Create a `JSONEncoder` and use it to encode as data one of the `Human` objects you have initialized. Then use that `Data` object to initialize a `String` representing the data that is stored, and print it to the console.
